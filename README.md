About the Project
-------------------
Traditionally, users look to review websites to get recommendations for which establishments to visit, be it through good reviews or high ratings. Nolp offers something completely different. It redefines what it means to be a review website. The purpose of Nolp is to provide users with a platform that, along with recommending highly rated establishments, also provides information on which establishments were generally disliked. The service provides valuable information for users who generally prefer to think outside the box - those who don't always go to the best-reviewed establishments and strive to experience something new. Nolp provides an opportunity for everyone to break away from the longstanding pattern of going to the best-reviewed establishments - all while ensuring that the experience is still enjoyable for everyone.

Let's say you wanted to try out a new restaurant in town. Instead of searching for each restaurant you come across on a generic review website, Nolp would offer you the capability of seeing all generally disliked restaurants in your area, eliminating the need to search up every place you come across. You will know what to avoid and what to enjoy at a moment's notice. Not only does Nolp work for restaurants, but it offers the same groundbreaking experience for almost any establishment you can dream of. This isn't an ordinary review website. This is Nolp. The future.
