About the Project
-------------------
Traditionally, users look to review websites to get reccomendations as to which establishment to visit, be it through good reviews or high ratings. The purpose of Nolp is to provide users with a platform that, along with reccomending establishments, also provides information on which establishments were generally disliked by users. This provides valuable information for users who generally perfer to think outside the box - those who dont always go to the best reviewed establishments and strive to experience something new. Nolp provides an opportunity for everyone to break away from the longstanding pattern of going to the best reviewed establishments - all while ensuring that the experience is still enjoyable for everyone.
